Simple text analyzer
====================

Takes as an argument the name of a text file, and outputs a CSV file with columns:

1. The word.
2. Frequency.
3. Frequency (in %). The CSV file is ordered in descending order of frequency, that is, the most frequent words should go at the beginning. Delimiters are all characters except letters and numbers.

Program command line arguments:

> word_count.exe input.txt output.csv
